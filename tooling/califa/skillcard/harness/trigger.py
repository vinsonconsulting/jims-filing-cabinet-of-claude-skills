"""Trigger evaluation harness (namespace-isolated) -- SPEC.md section D.

Measures whether a skill's *description* causes Claude to trigger (invoke the
skill) for a set of queries, and computes precision / recall / specificity.

PORTED from the cabinet's ``tooling/skill-eval/run_eval.py`` (itself a fork of
skill-creator's ``scripts/run_eval.py``), at fork commit ``ef6f952`` -- see
:data:`FORK_SHA` and SPEC section D. The fork fixes a measurement bug in the upstream
harness: under parallel workers, every run wrote its per-run, uuid-named proxy
command into the SAME shared ``project_root/.claude/commands`` and ran
``claude -p`` there, so look-alike proxies coexisted and the model frequently
invoked a SIBLING run's proxy. The own-uuid exact-match scoring then counted
that a miss -> systematic false-low recall that worsens with worker count (the
github-readme 0.139 artifact).

Two changes fix it, ported verbatim:
  1. Namespace isolation (the source fix): each run gets its OWN working dir under
     ``~/.cache/skill-eval-workspaces/<uuid>/`` containing only its own proxy, and
     ``claude -p`` runs there (``cwd=workdir``). Sibling proxies are never on a
     worker's path.
  2. Identity-match scoring (defense in depth): a hit is any first-tool invocation
     of a proxy for the skill-under-test (prefix ``<skill>-skill-``).

The only adaptation for califa: ``parse_skill_md`` reuses califa's frontmatter
parser instead of skill-creator's hand-rolled one.
