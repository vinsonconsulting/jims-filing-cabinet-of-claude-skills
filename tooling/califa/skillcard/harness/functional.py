"""Functional evaluation orchestrator (SPEC.md section D).

The trigger harness measures *whether* a skill fires; this measures *how well it
does the work* once it does. Convention: a skill provides
``evals/functional/{tasks.json, run_grader.py, graders.py, fixtures/}``. For each
task we run the skill's full workflow to completion in an isolated workspace -- the
real skill and the task's fixtures are present, and ``claude -p`` runs with
file-write permission so the skill produces its actual deliverable (a ``README.md``
written to disk). We then grade THAT artifact with the skill's OWN deterministic
``run_grader.py`` -- we never re-implement scoring. Aggregate:

* ``eval_pass_rate``       = mean over tasks of the grader's ``summary.pass_rate``
* ``task_completion_rate`` = fraction of tasks that fully pass (passed == total)

ARTIFACT GRADING (methodology). We grade the file the skill writes, not the
conversational ``claude -p`` stdout. Grading stdout scans Claude's wrapper prose
("here's your polished README...") alongside the deliverable, which trips strict
deterministic graders -- an em-dash or an AI-tell word in the wrapper fails a check
the README itself passes -- and floors the score. Grading the on-disk artifact
strips the wrapper, so the figures reproduce the cabinet's authoritative
deterministic graders (github-readme: 1.0/1.0). If the skill writes no file we fall
back to extracting the artifact from stdout, then to raw stdout: a graceful lower
bound, never a crash.

``generate`` is injectable: tests pass a stub that returns canned README text, so
the grade -> aggregate path runs with ZERO ``claude`` calls (``make check`` stays
offline). ``tool_call_delta`` / ``token_efficiency`` need a no-skill baseline run
and are left unset (both optional in the schema).
